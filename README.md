# 20220726_Databricks_Demo_Transfer_Learning_with_MLflow
We will go hands-on with an image classification of cats VS dogs demo using ***transfer learning***, while leveraging ***MLflow*** to track our model experiments on ***Databricks***.

You may find more information and a recording about this demo on [FourthBrain website](https://discover.fourthbrain.ai/live-session/databricks?utm_campaign=Databricks%20Event&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--F8VKHIPHNwly3IwFlBZT7uYi4Jn3-fqVCD3M9GJl2h8qjWSSemEn5fAiN0DF7uY7krt5DdxtgPo6hf6YqQX19orXAIw&utm_content=2&utm_source=hs_email).

If you would like Run this demo:

**1. Locally (for example, jupyter notebook):**

* Please follow [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning) link for tensorflow transfer learning tutorial.

**2. Or on Databricks FREE Community Edition:**
